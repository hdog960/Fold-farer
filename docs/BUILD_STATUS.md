# FoldFarer — live development status

## Aesthetic review build 0.1.0 (Milestone A, IN PROGRESS)

**GitHub repository:** https://github.com/hdog960/Fold-farer
**Candidate GitHub Pages URL:** https://hdog960.github.io/Fold-farer/

### Implemented in source
- Original layered SVG village illustration, near/far scenery, textured material palette, lighting, characters and shop details.
- Moveable Tavi with walk, scarf and arm animations in the landscape village, arrow controls, keyboard fallback, collision boundary at unrepaired bridge.
- Dialogue with Morrow and Mila, authored original opening scene, objective tracking.
- Authored Mend interaction: folded bridge animates, crossing collision changes.
- Deterministic first Paper Scrapper encounter, timing strike, Morrow Ink Needle, Fold Cover, Guard, retry and victory narrative.
- One localStorage preview checkpoint, in-world journal, restart confirmation.
- Manifest, installable static app shell candidate, service worker candidate for offline revisit.
- Reduced-motion CSS support, landscape orientation prompt.

### Not complete, not claimed
- This is not the 30–60 minute polished vertical slice in Phase 07.
- Art is code-drawn prototype artwork, NOT approved character turnaround/production atlas art, and has not passed the 90/100 visual gate.
- No dedicated finished character sprite atlases, multiple biomes/indoor scenes, extended quest graph, or full miniboss.
- No IndexedDB/manual save/export/migration, battle simulation test suite, recorded device performance, external licensing review, or Phaser/Vite/TypeScript pipeline.
- iPhone Safari/Home Screen behavior and accessibility are NOT yet physically verified.
- Pages URL and published availability must be verified separately, not inferred from a successful commit.

### Review rule
Milestone B remains LOCKED. The creator must personally assess the aesthetic of a real playable build. Fixes continue within Milestone A until accepted. Never substitute a static concept painting or this source check for actual on-device QA.

### Next checks
1. Confirm GitHub Pages build reaches the current committed index.html.
2. Open on real iPhone in landscape; inspect relative scale, texture quality, animation, z-order and text readability.
3. Play entire preview: Morrow -> seam -> Mila -> Scrapper -> ending; reload once during progress.
4. Capture real gameplay screenshots, establish device FPS/texture memory, record aesthetic acceptance/rejections.
5. Continue phases 00–07 to full scope before proposing Milestone B.

## Home Screen installation/update support
- Apple web-app metadata, PNG icon generation workflow, manifest icon sizes, and one stable Pages URL.
- Network-first service worker bypasses HTTP cache when online and keeps an offline fallback. Browser checks for worker updates when launched/resumed.
- iOS will load new published files when the app is next opened online; no reinstall is required. Background update while closed/offline is not guaranteed.
- iPhone on-device installation and actual cache/update behavior still need physical verification.

## First Fold 0.2.0 — walkable depth phase (Milestone A)

- Replaced left/right-only travel with an 8-way combined axis movement model, four-button iPhone D-pad, keyboard arrows/WASD, and tap-to-walk.
- Added a real 2D traversable ground footprint, house/propped garden collision, bridge-only crossing, diagonal normalization and directional animation poses.
- Authored original front, back, side Tavi SVG art. No more backwards moonwalking as the character moves away from camera.
- Player scale adjusts by distance to the camera; NPCs and paper props dynamically sort by projected foot depth, producing foreground occlusion.
- Added receding stitched flagstone courtyards, pop-up planter, notice board and bench to make paper scenery feel dimensional; the notice has optional interaction.
- Previous 0.1 local save key intentionally retained. Existing progress migrates the directional field and retains X/Y.
- GitHub Pages Home Screen URL and auto-update mechanism are unchanged; PWA cache bumped for updated scripts.
- Still NOT the visual acceptance target, and does not yet include interiors, free camera, camera-follow scrolling, polished sprite atlases, or the complete Milestone A vertical slice.
- Code automated tests and Playwright screenshots should be checked on latest run; physical iPhone testing remains outstanding.

## First Fold 0.3.0 — rooms, not only a corridor
- Added a separate navigable Threads workshop room, an authentic pop-up paper environment with back/side walls and a receding wood-plank floor.
- Actual entrance/exit interaction with scene transitions while preserving Tavi's quest and level state.
- The shared Tavi actor moves between scene layers, with per-room sorted occluders (loom, thread trolley, dye bench).
- Four-way traversable interior with its own collisions and a small original Mender's Loom discovery and optional collectible.
- The existing level remains a test scene and full 3D geometry is not used. Future rooms and world-map exploration will be developed during Milestone A. Visual acceptance still pending.

## First Fold 0.4.0 — original papercraft art pass
- Scalable hand-authored patterns for paper fibers, roof scales, leaf veins, cloth weave and wood grain applied to actual game geometry; no static concept art substituted.
- More layered distant ridges, varied canopy cutouts, house shutters, stitched roof edging and warm hanging lanterns; courtyard etchings, stones, tiny leaves and drifting motes.
- Improved the Threads workshop with hanging fabric, textile floor, painted lantern glows and a relocated sign; added Tavi coat/satchel details.
- No changes to game saves, original quest or movement; previous Home Screen icon URL maintained and service worker cache bumped.
- ART GATE NOT MET: character atlases, environment richness and animation remain significantly below the envisioned final visual standard; not approved for Milestone B.

## First Fold 0.4.1 — Morrow silhouette correction
- Replaced earlier ear-shaped blue creature with distinct original dark-ink feathered archivist bird: quill-like feather crest, beak, layered wings, stitched feather contours, feet, brass clasp and scroll.
- Separate subtle wing motions with reduced-motion support; retains Morrow actor ID, story, interaction zone and depth sorting.
- New versioned PWA cache, old save key unchanged. Artwork is still prototype quality; visual approval gate not met.
